To install simply use the latest suncult-<version>.xpi binary file.

Dragging and dropping the xpi file into the program should start the install.

Alternatively one can install via the 'Tools' menu.
E.g Thunderbird 3.0 within the application:
Menubar--->
Tools->Add-Ons->Install... <select file - suncult.xpi> Wait for install timer 'Install Now' - Restart

An internet search such as "how to install xpi firefox" can also help.

================

If you have acquired the source code - probably through svn - then running ./build.sh from the src/ directory will generate the .xpi to use.
